# Real-time-Auto-completion-Widget
“Real-Time Auto-Completion Widget” has two new features in real time alongside bash terminal, those are Double Press Tab(generating possible completion words) and Man Pages. This widget displays the completion of commands in set of 24 possibilities, and man pages on a scrollable window in two cases: when a command is completed on a terminal or when button on widget is clicked. We have also given a ‘lock’ button with which one can save the state of widget and refer this state while working in terminal. However, the features like man pages and double press tab are available in existing bash implementation, this work is recommended for the beginners and new users, so that they can overcome the complexities working with commands.
